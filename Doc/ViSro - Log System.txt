Litte Documentation about the Log system.

The log system from Visual Silkroad is for a detailed documenation of game processes. With this system it will be more 
easy to find people who use and abuse bugs. Also it is to detect for ex. spammers or scammers with the chat log. 
And when it produces to much data for the db you can disable it easy.
